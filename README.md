## :atom: Learning React

This repository is my first experience with **[React.js](https://reactjs.org/)**. I have been enjoying learning more about Web Development, and had a lot of fun completing this challenge.

We were given the task to create an interface to connect with the back-end we had developed previously. In this interface, the user must be able to add and remove repositories. I have utilized **[Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)** to make the HTTP requests.

I can't wait to learn more about React and the wonderful things it can do!
